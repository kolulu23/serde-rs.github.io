# Getting help

Serde is one of the most widely used Rust libraries so any place that Rustaceans
congregate will be able to help you out. For chat, consider trying the
[#rust-questions] or [#rust-beginners] channels of the unofficial community
Discord <i>(invite: <https://discord.gg/rust-lang-community>)</i>, the
[#rust-usage] or [#beginners] channels of the official Rust Project Discord
<i>(invite: <https://discord.gg/rust-lang>)</i>, or the [#general][zulip] stream
in Zulip. For asynchronous, consider the [\[rust\] tag on
StackOverflow][stackoverflow], the [/r/rust] subreddit which has a pinned weekly
easy questions post, or the Rust [Discourse forum][discourse].
